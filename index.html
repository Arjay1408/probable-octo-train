  <h2>Boracay</h2>
  <p>
    Long hailed as one of the best beaches in the entire world, Boracay’s claim to fame is its 4-kilometer stretch of pure white, powdery sand called White Beach.
    Cliche as it sounds, but White Beach is truly postcard-perfect, with tall coconut trees lined up and crystal-clear calm waters rounding up its unmatched beauty making it a top attraction in Boracay trips.

  <h2>Rice terraces</h2>
  <p>
    The Banaue Rice Terraces (Filipino: Hagdan-hagdang Palayan ng Banawe) are terraces that were carved into the mountains of Banaue, Ifugao, in the Philippines, by the ancestors of the indigenous people. The terraces are occasionally called the "Eighth Wonder of the World".

    The gateway to Philippine’s Last Frontier, Palawan, is its capital Puerto Princesa. It is here that you can find the world’s longest navigable underground river and a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the Puerto Princesa Underground River or the Puerto Princesa Subterranean River National Park.

  <h2>Rizal Park</h2>
  <p>
  Many travelers skip Manila and make their way to the Philippines' other islands but a day or two in the country’s capital to do Manila tours is still highly recommended.

Hustle and bustle aside, Manila features a lot of tourist spots of historical importance. One of which is the Rizal Park, or more commonly known as Luneta.

    As soon as your flight lands at the airport in Legazpi City, the world’s most perfect cone and the most active volcano in the Philippines greets you with its majesty. Mayon Volcano is one of the most beautiful places to visit in the Philippines and is a top attraction in tours of Bicol region.

      As if the lagoons and beaches of El Nido in Palawan is most famous for its paradise-like islands and lagoons but a 45-minute ride away through a land tour from its main town takes you to another idyllic destination: Nacpan Beach.
